About Me
-----------

**Background**

I grew up in Lost Cabin, Wyoming, a very small town of only five people. I am the last child of four, two older sisters and one older brother.  In high school I participated in band, drama, and speech and debate.  I participated in band for six years.  I played the French horn, trumpet, and alto horn.  I was in every one of my school productions since I was in the fifth grade, and I was one of the lead characters in every one since the seventh grade.  Of course, it was a small school, so there wasn't much competition.

Speech and debate was my main activity in high school.  In case you are not familiar with it, you can find more information about the activity on their website, [National Forensic League](http://www.nflonline.org/AboutNFL.AboutNFL "NFL").  I competed in Humorous Interpretation, Dramatic Interpretation, Duet Interpretation, Student Congress, and Extemporaneous Speaking.  I was a finalist at the National-Qualifying Tournament my first year in Dramatic Interpretation.  I won first place at the same tournament my fourth year in Extemporaneous Speaking.  The same year I won first place at the Wyoming State Speech Tournament.  My statistics can be found [here](http://www.nflonline.org/points_application/studentprofile.php?id=1189773 "Speech statistics").

**Interests**
-----------

Because I am the type of person to become completely immersed in the things I do, computer science has consumed much of my life.  I enjoy learning everything I can about computer programming and related topics.  I don't play video games because I would rather build a program or learn another language.

When I am not working on my computer, I like to spend time outdoors (when the weather is good).  In the summer, I go camping and hiking.  The mountains around Laramie, Wyoming provide an excellent environment for all things outdoors.  Just last summer I saw an entire family of moose on a trail at Happy Jack; it was amazing.  In the winter, I occasionally go skiing with my family at Red Lodge in Montana.
