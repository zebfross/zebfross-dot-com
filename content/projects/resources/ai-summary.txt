My function for making the computer play is relatively straight
forward. Wikipedia pointed out that in order to play a perfect
game of Tic-Tac-Toe, you have to do the following eight things 
in order:

	1. Win if you can
	2. Block if you can
	3. Fork to corner your opponent
	4. Block an opponent's fork
	5. Play at center
	6. Play in the opposite corner as your opponent
	7. Play in any empty corner
	8. Play in any empty side

Now, I didn't implement all eight of these, but this was 
definitely the basis of my programming.

To make my computer play, I told it to do the following in 
order:

	- If you can win, play to win

	- If you can block, block

	- If the opponent is planning to fork, block

		- Three other if statements testing for forks
	
	- If you can make two in a row, play as such

	- If center is empty, play in center

	- Play in empty corner

	- Play in empty side

So, of Wikipedia's eight items, I implement all but numbers 
three and six.  I didn't try to do number six because I wasn't
sure why it was a part of the list. Also, I couldn't think of an
efficient way of doing it. I didn't even attempt to code number
three because I thought it would have been too much work. My
code was already getting long, so I didn't want to add another
eight sets of if-else statements.
