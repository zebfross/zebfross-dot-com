		<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>

<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t like cookies? Cookies are a loaded dessert, bringing back thoughts of home or of grandma&rsquo;s house or of any number of other enjoyable memories. Being as culturally pervasive as cookies are, it would seem that people would have a fully-developed palette for them. This idea, however, is sadly false. Once cookies were valued, but now cookies are neglected. Because of today&rsquo;s overwhelming cookie selection, Americans have become blas√© and have lost sight of what makes a good cookie. cookies This confusion needs to be clarified. Peanut butter cookies are a superior cookie because of their flavor and simplicity.</p>

<p>To be superior, a cookie must be one thing most of all&ndash;moist. Honestly, when a cookie is dry from sitting out for a few days or from being baked just a little too long, the cookie is no good. Peanut butter cookies have overcome this condition by including peanut butter. The added peanut oils give the cookies the perfect amount of moistness. Making peanut butter cookies even more moist is the fact that they do not spread out much during baking, leaving less surface area to dry out.</p>

<p>Cookies that are difficult to make are the reason society is so out-of-touch with them. This difficulty makes cookies only for occasions instead of for everyday. Solving this problem is the simplicity of peanut butter cookies. With simple ingredients and easy instructions, peanut butter cookies can be enjoyed regularly, not just occasionally.</p>

<p>Understandably, chocolate chip cookies are another common favorite and may match peanut butter cookies in flavor and simplicity. Peanut butter cookies are still superior, however, because they are undeniably more moist, as aforementioned. The best of all worlds can even be achieved by adding chocolate chips to the peanut butter cookie batter, pleasing all potential partakers.</p>

<p>Considering all these arguments, it is obvious that peanut butter cookies are a superior cookie and should be enjoyed regularly. If not only because of increased moistness, peanut butter cookies are also superior in flavor and in simplicity. Everyone would be better off having a warm pan of freshly-baked peanut butter cookies waiting for them at home.</p>
