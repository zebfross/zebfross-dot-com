<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I grew up in Lost Cabin, Wyoming, a very small town of only five people. I am the last child of four, two older sisters and one older brother.  In high school I participated in band, drama, and speech and debate.  I participated in band for six years.  I played the French horn, trumpet, and alto horn.  I was in every one of my school productions since I was in the fifth grade, and I was one of the lead characters in every one since the seventh grade.  Of course, it was a small school, so there wasn’t much competition.</p>

<p>Speech and debate was my main activity in high school.  In case you are not familiar with it, you can find more information about the activity on their website, <a href="http://www.nflonline.org/AboutNFL.AboutNFL" title="NFL">National Forensic League</a>.  I competed in Humorous Interpretation, Dramatic Interpretation, Duet Interpretation, Student Congress, and Extemporaneous Speaking.  I was a finalist at the National-Qualifying Tournament my first year in Dramatic Interpretation.  I won first place at the same tournament my fourth year in Extemporaneous Speaking.  The same year I won first place at the Wyoming State Speech Tournament.  My statistics can be found <a href="http://www.nflonline.org/points_application/studentprofile.php?id=1189773" title="Speech statistics">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="interests"><strong>Interests</strong></h2>

<p>Because I am the type of person to become completely immersed in the things I do, computer science has consumed much of my life.  I enjoy learning everything I can about computer programming and related topics.  I don’t play video games because I would rather build a program or learn another language.</p>

<p>When I am not working on my computer, I like to spend time outdoors (when the weather is good).  In the summer, I go camping and hiking.  The mountains around Laramie, Wyoming provide an excellent environment for all things outdoors.  Just last summer I saw an entire family of moose on a trail at Happy Jack; it was amazing.  In the winter, I occasionally go skiing with my family at Red Lodge in Montana.</p>
